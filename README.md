hi guys
uh 

this repo contains a battleship game, made by a guy named abcxyz (you can find him in github, just search i think)
but his game looks wierd lol, bro cant even make his own ship




so anyways i made my *own* version, heres whats been added:

+Custom ships, background and buttons (very cool yes)

+Tracking mechanism (idk i guess it works, but just isnt alligned to the center)

+Ship changing button, choose from 4 different ships (very cool i made them myself)

+Health bar (if u collide with an obstacle u uh take damag, if u take too much damag u die and can restart ok cool)

planning to make more but kinda lazy

code is in python (which i actually don't know how to code well on it lol)
